# Global Environmental and Geo-economic Impact of Oxygen Strategies in Critical Care  

**Project Title:**  
Global environmental and geo-economic impact of conservative versus liberal oxygen strategies in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients: an ecological country-level analysis  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains data, code, and documentation for an ecological country-level analysis assessing the **environmental** and **geo-economic** consequences of conservative vs. liberal oxygen strategies in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.  

By linking critical care oxygen use scenarios with country-level energy and economic indicators, the study quantifies:  
- Carbon footprint and resource consumption  
- Geo-economic variability in oxygen supply chains  
- Trade-offs between conservative and liberal oxygen strategies
